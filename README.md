# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.


Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

# required
```bash
    mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
    
    # optional but recommended
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
    mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
    mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

Clone the starter
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rushmi0/lazyvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Remove the .git folder, so you can add it to your own repo later

```bash
  rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```

Start Neovim!

```bash
  nvim
```
